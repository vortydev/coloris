  transcript: Coloris is more than just a game. It's a collaborative project for
    which anyone and everyone is welcomed to contribute to! It was created and designed
    to showcase the passion, the time, and the effort that goes too often unnoticed
    in a game's music and sound effects. Coloris is also a fun, cute, and colorful
    little Tetris game, with a ton of customizability for a perfectly tailored experience.
    Enjoy!
