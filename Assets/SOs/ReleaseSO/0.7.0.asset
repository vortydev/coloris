  name: Beauty Lies In the Details Update
  description: This is a rather small release, but because I'm a huge semantic versionning
    nerd I made it it's own minor build increase. This update offers mostly under
    the hood optimisation, and sliders now have little blocks as knobs! I also removed
    voicelines in the tutorials because it made me cringe.

  changes:
  - Added SFX for the tutorial piece.
  - UI sliders now have colored blocks as knobs, because it's cute.
  - Difficulty is now locked in-game.
  - Removed voicelines.
