  newTracks:
  - Lucid Dreams by Kasper "FieryPenguin" Larson
  changes:
  - Reworked keybinds to something a bit more paletable.
  - Added a tutorial to learn the controls.
  - The radio UI now has a nice little typing effect.
  - Changed the screenshake to occur when lines are cleared.
  - Hard dropping can be toggled off.
  - Implemented Discord Rich Presence.
  - Added a donation button in the Extras panel in Options.
  bugfixes:
  - 002 - Music would skip when the game went out of focus.
